# UGTST-Reproduction

This repository reproduces the experiments from the paper:

**"An Uncertainty-guided Tiered Self-training Framework for Active Source-free Domain Adaptation in Prostate Segmentation" (MICCAI 2023)**

> This repo supports source domain training, active sample selection, and target domain self-training (Stage 1 and Stage 2) on the PROMISE12 dataset.
