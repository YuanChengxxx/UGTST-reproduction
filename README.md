# UGTST Reproduction

This repository reproduces the paper:  
**"An Uncertainty-guided Tiered Self-training Framework for Active Source-free Domain Adaptation in Prostate Segmentation"**

We reproduce the UGTST framework on the PROMISE12 dataset, implementing both source domain training and target domain adaptation with active learning and pseudo-labeling strategies.
